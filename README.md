# Predictive analysis of Savings Accounts

Using a predictive model I have tried to identify opportunities to cross-sell savings accounts to new or existing customers based on their behavior and characteristics.

In order to predict whether a client opens a savings account or not, a **Logistic Regression** was employed. The model used an underlying dataset of 45 211 customers, having a resulting accuracy of 87%.

The most determining factors that affect the client's will to open a savings account are the previous successful campaigns and contacting the client on a mobile phone, the chance increases by 96% and 109% respectively. On the other hand, the chances of successfully arranging a savings account drop dramatically if the client has a loan (by -78%) or a mortgage (by -77%) or defaulted (by -71%) on one of the payments in the past. Additionally, with every incremental contact regarding a specific campaign the more clients are less likely to open the account, as they may feel overwhelmed.
